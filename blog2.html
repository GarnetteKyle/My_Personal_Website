            <div class="introduction">
                <p>
                    Lately, I have been contemplating my future. I find myself constantly overthinking what I will
                    become, and the questions run in my head like a while loop that has not met its condition.
                    <strong>Will I be able to get a good job? What if I fail? What if I get left behind?</strong> What
                    if I wasn’t able to achieve the life I want? What if I become no one? I have fallen into the trap of
                    treating life like a high stakes competition where a single mistake feels like a disqualification.
                    My life just started, but I already feel desperate, wanting to achieve something that is quite
                    impossible to achieve in a short span of time. <strong>I am too focused worrying about the future
                        where I forgot to live in the present.</strong>
                </p>
            </div>

            <blockquote><q>Are we working hard to live, or are we living to work?</q></blockquote>

            <div class="blogBody">
                <p>But recently, something snapped in my head. I asked myself, <strong>Why am I doing this?</strong> I
                    realized I was trying to build the roof of a house before I had even poured the concrete for the
                    foundation. I am obsessed with what I should be doing in the next few years, but I haven’t even
                    built my foundation yet. I have been getting blinded by the lavish and luxurious lifestyles I see on
                    social media every single day.</p>

                <p>It is a strange kind of torture to scroll through a feed and see people my age, or even younger, who
                    seem to have it all figured out. I see the travel, the expensive cars, and the aesthetic offices,
                    and suddenly, <strong>my own room feels too small. My own progress feels like zero.</strong> It
                    makes me feel like I’m standing still while the rest of the world is running toward a finish line I
                    can't even see.</p>

                <p>This rat race isn't actually about moving forward. It is about the paralyzing fear of being seen as
                    less than others. <strong>I realized I’ve been running a marathon on a treadmill.</strong> I am
                    exhausted, sweaty, and breathless, yet I am staying in the exact same place because my progress was
                    purely mental. I’ve been so consumed by the idea of a lavish lifestyle that I’ve started to view my
                    current reality as a failure rather than a beginning. By obsessing over a version of myself that
                    doesn't exist yet, I was effectively skipping the very chapters of my life that are meant to define
                    who I am. Those chapters include the struggle, the confusion, and the small, boring steps of
                    learning.</p>

                <p>We are taught that success is a sprint, but I’m realizing that <strong>a foundation built on speed
                        rather than depth is destined to crumble.</strong> You cannot rush the growth of a tree, and you
                    certainly cannot rush the growth of a human life. The more I look at those filtered screens, the
                    more I lose sight of the unfiltered potential of my own hands. I’ve been so busy looking at where
                    everyone else is running that I haven't noticed I’m already on my own path. It just doesn't look
                    like theirs, and that has to be okay.</p>
            </div>

            <blockquote><q>If success were invisible, would you still chase it the same way?</q></blockquote>

            <div class="conclusion">
                <p>I am learning that <strong>you cannot rush a foundation.</strong> If I build my life on the speed of
                    achievement rather than the depth of learning, the structure will eventually fall apart. I’m
                    choosing to break the loop of overthinking. Instead of fearing I’ll become no one, I am focusing on
                    becoming myself. The rat race only has power if you believe the finish line is real. But the truth
                    is that the finish line keeps moving every time you get close to it.</p>

                <p>I’m stepping off the track to realize that <strong>life isn't a race to be won, but a story to be
                        lived.</strong> I don't want to look back in ten years and realize I was so busy worrying about
                    the future that I never actually experienced being young. The future will arrive in its own time.
                    For now, I am finally content to just be here, building my foundation one brick at a time and
                    learning to breathe again.</p>

                <p>
                <blockquote><q>You don’t lose the rat race by slowing down, you lose it by never questioning it.</q>
                </blockquote>
