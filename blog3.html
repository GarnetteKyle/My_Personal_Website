        <p>
          If my life as a Computer Science Student is a program, it would definitely be <strong>spaghetti code</strong>.
          Tangled, confusing, full of random if-else statements that don’t always make sense but somehow still runs,
          barely. Whenever someone asks, <strong>“So, what’s your plan after graduation?”</strong> I wish I could just
          hit Ctrl+Z and rewrite my entire answer. Because truthfully, I’m still <strong>debugging my career
            goals</strong> and the syntax is a mess.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="blogBody">
        <p>Whenever people ask me what I want to be, I always answer confidently, <strong>“I want to be a software
            developer.”</strong> It sounds good, right? Professional, expert, tech wizard, technical, and just vague
          enough to sound like I know what I’m doing. But lately, I’ve started to realize that <strong>“software
            developer” isn’t just one thing</strong>. It’s a whole buffet of possibilities.</p>

        </div>

        <p>There’s the <strong>front end developer</strong>, the creative one who makes things look nice and
          interactive. Then there’s the <strong>back end developer</strong>, the mastermind who builds what happens
          behind the scenes, the magic that the user cannot see but actually makes everything work.</p>

        <p>There’s the <strong>full stack developer</strong>, the mythical creature who somehow does both and survives.
          Then there are mobile developers, game developers, AI engineers, data scientists, and cybersecurity developers
          who spend their time protecting systems from the same hackers that movies make look cool.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="conclusion">
        <p>So when I say <strong>“software developer,”</strong> what do I actually mean? Honestly, I don’t even know
          anymore. I feel like a kid in a <strong>Toys 'R' Us</strong>. Everything looks shiny and exciting, and I want
          to get it all. But I can't own everything. So here I am, like my code. <strong>Confused but running.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>When I first chose BSCS, I thought it was simple. Learn to code, graduate, get a job, done. But the deeper I
          go, the more I realize this field is massive. Guess what, even AI is stealing my job. Each topic leads to
          another one, and suddenly you’re three YouTube tutorials deep learning something you didn’t even know existed.
        </p>

        <p>And that’s the thing. <strong>The more I learn, the more I realize how little I actually know.</strong> It’s
          terrifying but kind of thrilling too. Every project, every assignment, every late night debug session makes me
          see a new side of computer science. Maybe that’s the beauty of it. There’s no single right path. Just like in
          programming, <strong>there’s more than one way to make something work.</strong> The "404" isn't a dead end, it
          is just a signal that I am exploring territory I haven't mapped out yet. I might not know where this path
          leads, but I am clicking "Run" anyway.</p>
