            <div class="introduction">
                <p>
                    I am certain that when you’re scrolling through social media (Tiktok,Facebook,YouTube),
                    there are instances that you’ve encountered a post in your feed that says <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI) would take over programmers' jobs</strong> in the near future. Many are worried, and afraid,
                    contemplating whether they continue the path to this career or not.
                </p>
            </div>
            <blockquote> And I am one of them. </blockquote>
            <div class="introduction">
                <p>
                As someone who is still learning and building my skills in programming, seeing these posts sometimes
                makes me <strong>doubt myself</strong> and wonder if the effort I’m putting in will still matter in the future.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="blogBody">
                <p>It is true that AI did manage to help us on a day to day basis: <strong>Students, Teachers, Workers, and even elderly</strong>. Like students using Generative AI to help them study. Can’t understand the formula of a
                    specific math formula? AI. Need to find a definition of a specific word? AI. Need a guide to do a
                    specific task? AI. </p>

                <p>But what seems to appear as an ordinary tool, can actually <strong>replace you</strong>. With one prompt, it can generate a graphic design, audio, and program codes which ironically created them in the first place.
                </p>

                <p>Recently, there are a lot of companies laying off their employees, even programmers. What replace
                    them? Still humans but it is a human who knows AI, how it works, and how to build it. They can do as
                    much as one department can do. <strong>Less employees → less payroll → fewer job opportunities.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a college student, it’s making me worry. It is not just about logical thinking and programming
                    anymore. I am just about to graduate and I’m already about to compete with <strong>hundreds of thousands of people</strong> who are also seeking employment and have better skills than me.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="conclusion">
                <p>That means that I need to have the knowledge and skills of professionals as soon as I graduate. But
                    it is what it is, we can’t and we can never stop evolution. The only thing we can do is to <strong>adapt in order to survive</strong>. Utilize AI itself to gain knowledge and skills. </p>

                <blockquote>So will programmers survive? <strong>Yes, for people who see AI as a tool, not god.</strong></blockquote>
