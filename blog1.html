                <p>
                    I am certain that when you’re scrolling through social media (Tiktok,Facebook,YouTube),
                    there are instances that you’ve encountered a post in your feed that says Artificial Intelligence
                    (AI) would take over programmers jobs in the near future. Many are worried, and afraid,
                    contemplating whether they continue the path to this career or not.
            </div>
            <blockquote> And I am one of them. </blockquote>
            <div class="introduction">
                As someone who is still learning and building my skills in programming, seeing these posts sometimes
                makes me doubt myself and wonder if the effort I’m putting in will still matter in the future.

                </p>

            <br>
            <div class="blogBody">
                <p>It is true that AI did manage to help us on a day to day basis. Students, Teachers, Workers, and even
                    elderly. Like students using Generative AI to help them study. Can’t understand the formula of a
                    specific math formula? AI. Need to find a definition of a specific word? AI. Need a guide to do a
                    specific task? AI. </p>

                <p>But what seems to appear as an ordinary tool, can actually replace you. With one prompt, it can
                    generate a graphic design,audio, and program codes which ironically created them in the first place.
                </p>

                <p>Recently, there are a lot of companies laying off their employees, even programmers. What replace
                    them? Still humans but it is a human who knows AI, how it works, and how to build it. They can do as
                    much as one department can do. What does it mean? It means less employees then less payroll, less
                    employment then less job opportunities.</p>

                <p>
                    As a college student, it’s making me worry. It is not just about logical thinking and programming
                    anymore. I am just about to graduate and I’m already about to compete with hundreds of thousands of
                    people who’s also seeking employment and have better skills than me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="conclusion">
                <p>That means that I need to have the knowledge and skills of professionals as soon as I graduate. But
                    it is what it is, we can’t and we can never stop evolution. The only thing we can do is to adapt in
                    order to survive. Utilize AI itself to gain knowledge and skills. </p>
