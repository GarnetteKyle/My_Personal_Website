          Hi, my name is <strong>Garnette Kyle Valenzuela</strong>, I was born and raised in <b>Tondo, Manila</b>, and I can’t wait to leave this place.<sup>1</sup>
                    My friends always tease me because of my name.<sup>2</sup>
                    Some say I was a basketball player because my name is similar to Kevin Garnett.<sup>3</sup>
                    And some say my name is derived from <i>Garnet  Stone</i>.<sup>4</sup>
                    But my name is just literally a <em>logical</em> mix of my parents’ names.<sup>5</sup>
                    When I was a kid, I always put myself in trouble.<sup>6</sup>
                    There was an accident where I was running and tripped, and my left forearm got sliced by an iron sheet.<sup>7</sup>
                    Another time, I was playing with my classmates and tripped again, and my tooth broke.<sup>8</sup>
                    I also remember the day my friend almost hit my eye with a pencil.<sup>9</sup>
                    I can say that I had a happy childhood.<sup>10</sup>
                    But of course, there are always two sides of the coin.<sup>11</sup>
                    I also experienced bullying because I was overweight back then.<sup>12</sup>
                    I have friends, but there are very few classmates who, for some reason, love bullying.<sup>13</sup>
                    I always got involved in fights because of it.<sup>14</sup>
                    But I had already built the character of a nice, kind, quiet, and gentle boy in my teachers’ and classmates’ minds, that’s why I was never scolded by our teachers or had a bad record in the Guidance Office.<sup>15</sup>
                    I hope they’re doing fine.<sup>16</sup>
                    We were kids back then, we make mistakes and still have a lot of lessons to learn.<sup>17</sup>
                    Looking back, those early scrapes taught me resilience.<sup>18</sup>
                    I learned that <q>pain is temporary</q> but memories last.<sup>19</sup>
                    This foundation shaped who I am today.<sup>20</sup>

        I studied at <b>Jose Abad Santos High School</b> in <b>Binondo, Manila</b>.<sup>1</sup>
                    When I was in 7th grade, I had a lot of friends.<sup>2</sup>
                    We always played mobile games every vacant time, walking back home together after class.<sup>3</sup>
                    But in 8th grade, I felt like I didn’t belong.<sup>4</sup>
                    I only had two friends, while the whole class was always together and getting along with each other.<sup>5</sup>
                    That’s why at that time, all I did was play online games.<sup>6</sup>
                    The school year was still ongoing when COVID came.<sup>7</sup>
                    Almost my whole junior high school was conducted online.<sup>8</sup>
                    I didn’t know what to feel at that time, whether to be happy to avoid socializing with people or sad because I might have missed one of the happiest stages of my life.<sup>9</sup>
                    After 10th grade, everything started to go back to normal.<sup>10</sup>
                    Since I spent the whole time playing online games, I took ICT–Computer Programming as my senior high school strand and track.<sup>11</sup>
                    I told myself that I cannot live isolating myself; that’s why I started socializing and making friends with everyone, and it went well.<sup>12</sup>
                    I met a lot of friends.<sup>13</sup>
                    I really loved my senior high school days as they were one of the happiest moments of my life.<sup>14</sup>
                    But it is also one of the stages of my life that I want to forget.<sup>15</sup>
                    Things turned bitter.<sup>16</sup>
                    After graduation, I cut ties.<sup>17</sup>
                    I just hope that in college, I will build something again and move forward in life.<sup>18</sup>
                    I want to leave those bitter <s>memories</s> behind.<sup>19</sup>
                    I am ready for a <u>new chapter</u>.<sup>20</sup>

      <h2>College Years</h2>

          College came, and I still can’t believe that I will be studying at the <b>University of the East</b> under the <b>BSCS</b> program.<sup>1</sup>
                    I was considering studying at cheap private colleges, but my aunts insisted that I study here instead.<sup>2</sup>
                    I did try to apply to state universities, but I was only able to take the entrance exam at PLM.<sup>3</sup>
                    I still remember putting a sad emoticon on the back of my scratch paper because I knew deep inside that I had flunked the exam.<sup>4</sup>
                    I don’t even know why I felt sad, knowing that I hadn’t even spent a single day reviewing.<sup>5</sup>
                    Then I received an email from PLM, and no, it was not a plot twist showing that I passed.<sup>6</sup>
                    It was just to show me that I really failed the exam.<sup>7</sup>
                    Now, let's focus on the actual college experience.<sup>8</sup>
                    On my first day of class, I entered the room knowing I was early, but for some reason, there was a professor sitting at the front.<sup>9</sup>
                    I asked if I was in the correct section, and I was.<sup>10</sup>
                    Then, our professor realized that we were not supposed to meet that day, it was supposed to be the next day.<sup>11</sup>
                    It was so funny that it happened during the first day that I remember it up to this day.<sup>12</sup>
                    Moving forward, I met a lot of friends, especially during my NSTP-ROTC days.<sup>13</sup>
                    I experienced many new things I had never tried before, traveling to far places, eating outside, and just enjoying life.<sup>14</sup>
                    College is tiring, both physically and mentally.<sup>15</sup>
                    To be honest, I sometimes feel like I’m getting left behind, doubting if I really belong in this program.<sup>16</sup>
                    But I know deep inside that it is part of the process, and I won’t let it consume me or bring me down.<sup>17</sup>
                    Yes, college is tiring, but that is also where you feel alive.<sup>18</sup>
                    I still make mistakes, and sometimes I get frustrated, but I try to laugh at myself.<sup>19</sup>
                    I always think of the life I want, so I will try my best and keep moving forward.<sup>20</sup>
